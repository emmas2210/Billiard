### ***Goal:***

The goal of this project is to be able to produce videos and widget representing a point/ball in a billiard with a simple shape and showing its trajectory.


### ***Plan :***

Firstly, we are going to start with the simplest case: a square billard.
In this example, we assume that there is no friction and the Descartes rules are satisfied.
Then, we will be studying another case : the flat torus billard.
Actually, a torus is a surface of revolution generated by revolving a circle in three-dimensional space about an axis that is coplanar with the circle. 
We will end up studying the elliptic case.


### ***Flat Torus case :***

You then will study the case of the flat torus billiard. A flat toru is described here https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torus#Flat_torus, if needed.


## ***Elliptic case :***
Finally, provide elements mimicking the following video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7mPzrNJHkA&list=PLTgIq68k2wHH31X-pkBDu2QVeA85G8OHV&index=2&t=0s
