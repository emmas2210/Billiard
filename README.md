Goal:

The goal of this project is to be able to produce videos and widget representing a point/ball in a billiard with a simple shape and showing its trajectory.


Plan :

Firstly, we are going to start with the simplest case: a square billard.
In this example, we assume that there is no friction and the Descartes rules are satisfied.
Then, we will be studying another case : the flat torus billard.
Actually, a torus is a surface of revolution generated by revolving a circle in three-dimensional space about an axis that is coplanar with the circle. 
We will end up studying the elliptic case.
