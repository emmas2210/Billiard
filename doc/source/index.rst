Welcome to Billiard's documentation!
====================================

Billiard is a package producing videos and widgets representing a point/ball in a billiard with a simple shape
and showing its trajectory. There are two billiard's shapes:

   1) Square Billiard.
   2) Flat and 3d Torus Billiard.
