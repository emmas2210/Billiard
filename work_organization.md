* Histogram, 

# Different steps :
 

## 1st part : 
- Introduction and plan's construction 
- Creation of square billiard with its words system.
- Creation of the files needed to do tests, create package 

The first part is due on March 29th.         

## 2nd part : 
- Creation of the flat torus billiard.
- Creation of the test functions

Scheduled on April 28th.

## 3rd part : 
- The hardest case, the elliptic billiard
