In this file, we are going to list the different tasks of our project as well as the plan.
 

# Distribution of tasks :

Emma Santinelli : Introduction and plan's construction, create a function to list words, work organization, elliptic billiard's construction                  
Selena Iskounen : Creation of square billiard and elliptic billiard, creation of test function                                 
Oumyama Khalifi :  Start to find out how to do the flat torus billiard, create the flat torus billiard                                                         


# Different steps :
 

## 1st part : 
- Introduction and plan's construction 
- Creation of square billiard with its words system.
- Creation of the files needed to do tests, create package 

The first part is due on March 29th.         

## 2nd part : 
- Creation of the flat torus billiard.
- Creation of the test functions

Scheduled on April 20th.

## 3rd part : 
- The hardest case, the elliptic billiard
