Torus Billiard
===================
Flat Torus Billiard
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The flat torus is a torus with the metric inherited from its representation as the quotient R^2/L, 
where L is a discrete subgroup of R^2 isomorphic to Z^2. This gives the quotient the structure of a Riemannian manifold.
It can also be described by this Cartesian plane (x, y) ~ (x + 1, y) ~ (x, y + 1). This particular flat torus is known as 
"square" flat torus. 
The class and the function that we have created will allow us to visualize the displacement of a ball on this billiard in 
the shape of a flat torus.

3D Torus Billiard
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
In geometry, a torus (plural tori) is a surface of revolution generated by revolving a circle in three-dimensional space about 
an axis that is coplanar with the circle. The parametric equation of a torus is given by: 

x(u,v) = R +(rcos(u))cos(v)

y(u,v) = R +(Rcos(u))sin(v)

z(u,v) = rsin(v)

where R is the distance between the center of the tube and the center of the torus, r the radius of the circle and u,v \in [0,2pi]

We use mayavi to see the ball deplacement in the volume delimited by the torus and the collisions with the surface of the torus.
